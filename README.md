# AO3-Tone-Marks

This is based on GodofLaundryBaskets [Google Docs Tone Mark Script](https://godoflaundrybaskets.dreamwidth.org/3315.html) and Cathalinaheart's [Tampermonkey version](https://github.com/Cathalinaheart/AO3-Tone-Marks).

Still figuring out what I want to do with it exactly. Current experimental version can be installed [here](https://github.com/irrationalpie7/AO3-Tone-Marks/raw/main/Tone%20Marks%20II.pub.user.js).
