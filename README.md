# AO3-Tone-Marks

This is based on GodofLaundryBaskets <a href="">Google Docs Tone Mark Script.</a>

You need to have tampermonkey/greasemonkey installed and then you just need to click <a href="https://github.com/Cathalinaheart/AO3-Tone-Marks/raw/main/Tone%20Marks.pub.user.js">here</a> to install it.

I...don't really know what I am doing here? But it should work and I am planning on adding more fandoms. Currently MDZS, Guardian and NiF are supported.
