# AO3-Tone-Marks

This is based on GodOfLaundryBasket's [Google Docs Tone Mark Script](https://godoflaundrybaskets.dreamwidth.org/3315.html) and Cathalinaheart's [Tampermonkey version](https://github.com/Cathalinaheart/AO3-Tone-Marks). Once you've installed Tampermonkey/greasemonkey, you can install my version (called "Tone Marks II" to differentiate from Cathalinaheart's version) by clicking [here](https://github.com/irrationalpie7/AO3-Tone-Marks/raw/main/Tone%20Marks%20II.pub.user.js). If you have Cathalinaheart's version installed and you want to see how mine works, you will probably have to temporarily disable their version (click on the tampermonkey/greasemonkey extension and you should get a pop-up that lets you do that), otherwise the two scripts will fight.

My version currently underlines replaced words, and has a slightly different format for specifying replacements that I find easier to maintain.
